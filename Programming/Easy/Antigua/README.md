# Antigua

For this CTF, the easiest thing to do is to make sure that you have `rustc`, and Rust in general, installed before calling `rustc main.rs`. If you have prior experience with Rust, this should be easy; if not, I suggest you skim through the References and get a handle on the language. The completed `main.rs` is included for comparison, and the final output should look something like this:

```
$ ./main
